      "     - Sector-specific movement: Certain sectors gaining traction while others face net outflows (e.g., tech vs. energy).\n",
      "   - **Long-term Context (past 30 days):**\n",
      "     - Baseline conditions: General market consolidation with occasional breakouts near key technical levels.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### 2. **Identified Patterns and Trends:**\n",
      "   - **Market Structure Analysis:**\n",
      "     - Institutional flow dominance over retail traders observed on larger-cap assets.\n",
      "     - Cross-asset correlations suggesting a risk-on environment, with equities moving in tandem with crypto and commodities.\n",
      "   - **Risk-Return Dynamics:**\n",
      "     - Elevated implied volatility in derivatives markets across multiple asset classes.\n",
      "     - Flattening of the volatility term structure suggests immediate concerns about short-term risks but relatively muted long-term fears.\n",
      "   - **Sentiment & Positioning:**\n",
      "     - Extreme crowd sentiment metrics indicate heightened bullishness on certain assets, signaling potential overextension.\n",
      "   - **Macro Environment:**\n",
      "     - Central bank monetary policy remains a driving force with hawkish tones, resulting in cautious optimism across markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. **Contextual Factors:**\n",
      "   - External factors such as earnings season, key economic data releases, and geopolitical tensions are creating higher sensitivity in asset valuations.\n",
      "   - Regulatory shifts and fiscal reforms in certain regions create uncertainty, particularly in tech and financial sectors.\n",
